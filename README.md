System Information Dashboard is a small, fast and portable tool designed to help you see what’s really going on inside your computer – without digging through multiple Windows menus.

From a single window you can monitor CPU usage, RAM usage, disk space, system uptime, and core OS information. It’s ideal for technicians, power users, or anyone who just wants a quick overview of their system status.

You don’t need to install anything heavy, deal with ads, or sign up for an account. Just run the app and you immediately get a clean dashboard with the most important system info.

What the app does

System Information Dashboard:

Shows live CPU usage

Monitors RAM (memory) usage
Quickly check how much RAM is in use and how much is free, so you know if your system is running out of memory.

Displays disk usage
View free and used space on your drives, so you can see when a disk is close to full.

Shows system uptime
See how long your PC has been running since the last reboot – handy for troubleshooting and server/always-on machines.

Provides OS and system details
Basic information about your Windows version and system, so you have the important details in one place when you need them.

Generates system reports
Export your system information to a text or HTML report, so you can save it, send it to a technician, or keep it for documentation.

Lightweight and portable
No complex installer, no background services. Just a simple executable you can keep on your USB stick or tools folder.
