# System Information Dashboard

System Information Dashboard is a lightweight, portable Windows utility that shows you the essentials at a glance:  
**CPU load, RAM usage, disk usage, OS details, and system uptime** in a clean, single window.

It’s built for technicians and power users who want quick diagnostics without the bloat of full monitoring suites.

  - Single `.exe` – no installer
  - No services, no scheduled tasks, no junk left behind
